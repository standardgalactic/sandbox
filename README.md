# NCL_sandbox
Is a collection of NULL Convention Logic (NCL) circuits and libraries written in Verilog to provide the experience of logically determined design in a familiar context. The tools used are Icarus Verilog and gtkwave. The collection begins with the most basic circuits and will progress to more functionality and complexity.
